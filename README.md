> Studio Code.

**_powershell-lsp-server_** is a minimalist server back-end for
providing PowerShell completion using the Language Server Protocol.

The software is primarily targeting GNU Emacs users, but should work
properly with other text-editors given software implementation of the
_Language Server Protocol_ as client.

## Features

This command _will_ provide a variety of features for PowerShell
development.

Current planned features sorted by importance are:

- **TODO**: PowerShellEditorServices installer
- **TODO**: LSP Server
- **TODO**: Intelligent completion (intellisense)
- **TODO**: Syntax checking
- **TODO**: Contextual documentation
- **TODO**: Definition resolutions
- **TODO**: Symbol references
- **TODO**: Symbol highlighting
- **TODO**: Intelligent refactoring (not sure if it’s supported)

## Requirements

* OpenSSL 1.0.0 or later
* .Net Core/Mono/.Net Framework
* PowerShell 5.0 or later.  Note however that I’m testing it using the
  6.x.x version

## Installation

There’s currently no way to install this program since it’s not
finished.

It would be nice to get multi-platform installation support.
